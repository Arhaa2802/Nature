        <h2>About</h2>
        <h3 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;"> The fauna of South America consists of a huge variety of
            unique animals some of which evolved in relative isolation. The isolation of South America had an abrupt end
            some few million years ago when the Isthmus of Panama was formed allowing small scale migration of animals
            that would result in the Great American Interchange. South America is the continent with the largest number
            or recorded bird species</h3>

        <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-right: 200px; margin-left: 200px;"> Sloths are a group of arboreal Neotropical
            xenarthran mammals, constituting the suborder Folivora. Noted for their slowness of movement, they spend
            most of their lives hanging upside down in the trees of the tropical rainforests of South America and
            Central America.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-right: 200px; margin-left: 200px;">The capybara is a giant cavy rodent native
            to South America. It is the largest living rodent. Also called capivara, capiguara, chigüire, chigüiro, or
            fercho, carpincho and ronsoco, it is a member of the genus Hydrochoerus, of which the only other extant
            member is the lesser capybara.</p>
