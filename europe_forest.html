        <h2> About </h2>
        <h3>Forests in the European Union: valuable multifaceted and multi-purpose ecosystems. ... In total, forests
            cover 37.7 % of the EU's land area and the six Member States with the largest forest areas (Sweden, Finland,
            Spain, France, Germany and Poland) account for two thirds of the EU's forested areas (3.2. 10).</h3>
        <h2>1.Black Forest</h2>

        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-right: 70px;  margin-left: 70px;">Germany’s Black Forest is perhaps central
            Europe’s most famous forest. This stunning mountainous region in
            south-west Germany has it all—dense evergreen forests, dramatic mountains, and quaint villages. It’s home
            to
            cuckoo clocks dating back to the 1700s, and many villages feel eerily stuck in a distant time. The fairytale
            atmosphere lends itself perfectly to full escapism from the real world.</p>

        <h2>2.Białowieża Forest</h2>

        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-right: 70px;  margin-left: 70px;">Finland is packed full of natural beauty,
            and the Wild Taiga forests are no exception. This pristine attraction in Finland’s north east has a rich
            culture and traditions, but many also flock to it for the views, wildlife and both summer and winter
            activities. Though peaceful and remote, there’s a definite sense of calm and safety while in the reaches of
            this vast reserve.

        <h2>3.Hallerbos Forest</h2>

        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-right: 70px;  margin-left: 70px;">Hallerbos Forest, or “The Blue Forest”, is a stunning forest perfect for long scenic hikes. The vast carpets
            of bluebells which pop up in mid-April each year give the beautiful forest it name. There are also giant
            Sequoia trees that make a visit to this beautiful stretch of land a humbling and rejuvenating experience.
