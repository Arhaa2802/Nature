        <h2> About </h2>
        <h3> Forests and other wooded land today cover approximately 850 million ha in North America, slightly more than
            40 percent of the total land area. Of this, forests account for about 500 million ha, or 25 percent of the
            land area.</h3>

        <p class="p_asiaF"> Gifford Pinchot National Forest is a National Forest located in southern Washington, USA,
            managed by the United States Forest Service. With an area of 1.32 million acres, it extends 116 km along the
            western slopes of Cascade Range from Mount Rainier National Park to the Columbia River. Its many rivers,
            lakes and streams contain a variety of fish
            like chinook salmon, coho salmon, steelhead trout, cutthroat trout and rainbow trout. Terrestrial species
            include elk, black bear, mountain goats, and bobcats.</p>

        <p class="p_asiaF">The Tongass National Forest in Southeast Alaska is the largest U.S. National Forest at 16.7
            million acres.
            Most of its area is temperate rain forest and is remote enough to be home to many species of endangered and
            rare flora and fauna. Sadly, Tongass National Forest is one of America's most exploited forests, with
            decades of forestry clearcut scars to prove it. Currently, some of its wildest stretches of forest--called
            "inventoried roadless areas"--and under threat, which could lead to similar dangers for wild forests across
            the county.

        <h2> 3.Pisgah and Nantahala National Forests </h2>

        <p class="p_asiaF">The Nantahala National Forest, is the largest of the four national forests in North Carolina,
            lying in the
            mountains and valleys of western North Carolina. Second to the Pacific Northwest, the Nantahala is the
            wettest region in the country.The Pisgah and Nantahala national forests of western North Carolina may be
            best known for their explosive displays of fall foliage. Every year, the two forests, totalling some 1
            million acres, carpet the Blue Ridge Mountains in reds, yellows and oranges. But even off-season, the
            old-growth stretches of oak, hemlock, tulip poplar, pine, sycamore, dogwood and beech beckon visitors in
            search of hiking, fishing and other outdoor recreation (together, the Pisgah and Nantahala contain over 200
            miles of the Appalachian Trail). Six wilderness areas between the two forests attest that some relatively
            unspoiled land remains on the east coast. Black bears, deer, wild boar and other wildlife can be found
            throughout the region.
