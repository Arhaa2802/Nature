        <h2>About</h2>
        <h3 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;"> The fauna of North America is all the animals living in
            the Continental United States and its surrounding
            seas and islands, the Hawaiian Archipelago, Alaska in the Arctic, and several island-territories in the
            Pacific and in the Caribbean. The U.S. has many endemic species found nowhere else on Earth. With most of
            the North American continent, the U.S. lies in the Nearctic, Neotropic, and Oceanic faunistic realms, and
            shares a great deal of its flora and fauna with the rest of the American supercontinent. </h3>

        <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-right: 200px; margin-left: 200px;">
            The pronghorn is a unique North American mammal. Its Latin name, Antilocapra americana, means "American
            goat-antelope," but it is not a member of the goat or the antelope family and it is not related to the
            antelopes found in Africa.

        <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-right: 200px; margin-left: 200px;">
            The striped skunk is a skunk of the genus Mephitis that occurs across much of North America, including
            southern Canada, the United States, and northern Mexico. It is currently listed as least concern by the IUCN
            on account of its wide range and ability to adapt to human-modified environments.
