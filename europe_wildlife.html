        <h2>About</h2>
        <h3 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;"> The fauna of Europe is all the animals living in Europe and
            its surrounding seas and islands. Since there is no natural biogeographic boundary in the east and south
            between Europe and Asia, the term "fauna of Europe" is somewhat elusive.</h3>
