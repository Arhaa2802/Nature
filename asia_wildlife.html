        <h2>About</h2>
        <h3 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px;">All of the animals living in Asia and its surrounding seas
            and islands are considered the fauna of Asia.
            Since there is no natural biogeographic boundary in the west between Europe and Asia, the term "fauna of
            Asia" is somewhat elusive. Temperate Asia is the eastern part of the Palearctic realm (which in turn is part
            of the Holarctic), and its south-eastern part belongs to the Indomalayan realm (previously called the
            Oriental region). Asia shows a notable diversity of habitats, with significant variations in rainfall,
            altitude, topography, temperature and geological history, which is reflected in its richness of animal life.

            The Asian elephant, also known as the Asiatic elephant, is the only living species of the genus Elephas and
            is distributed throughout the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, from India in the west, Nepal in the
            north, Sumatra in the south, and to Borneo in the east. </p>

        <h2> 2.Bengal Tiger (Endangered)</h2>

        <p style="font-size: 25px; margin-right: 200px; margin-left: 200px;"> The Bengal tiger is a tiger from a
            specific population of the Panthera tigris tigris subspecies that is
            native to the Indian subcontinent. It is threatened by poaching, loss, and fragmentation of habitat, and was
            estimated at comprising fewer than 2,500 wild individuals by 2011.</p>
